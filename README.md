# React Native First App

Welcome to my first React Native app project! This project serves as an introduction to React Native, focusing on positioning, component dimensions, the Box Object Model, and implementing a counter feature.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

## FEATURES
*Positioning:* Practice different positioning techniques such as absolute, relative, and flexbox.

*Component Dimensions:* Experiment with different component dimensions and layout.

*Box Object Model:* Understand how padding, margin, and border affect the layout.
